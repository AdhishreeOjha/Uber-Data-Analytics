This project aims towards analyzing the tlc-trip-data record of UBER for NYC.
Dataset contains various information related to pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.

The dataset can be accessed from here: https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

The code for executing the project has been put in the "Code" section.

But if someone wants to access my colab file, do send a request for getting the access.
